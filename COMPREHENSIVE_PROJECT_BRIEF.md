# Project Brief: Smart Home CRM - Customer Relationship Management System

## Introduction / Problem Statement

Smart home integration companies face unique challenges in managing customer relationships, projects, and business operations. Unlike traditional CRMs, these businesses need specialized tools that handle:

- **Complex multi-property customer relationships** - High-net-worth residential clients often have multiple properties requiring different smart home solutions
- **Project-centric sales cycles** - Revenue comes from installation projects, not recurring subscriptions, requiring detailed project management and financial tracking
- **Technical team coordination** - Field technicians need mobile access to update project status, report issues, and access technical documentation
- **Specialized skill matching** - Projects require team members with specific certifications (Control4, Lutron, Crestron, Network+, etc.)
- **Financial complexity** - Projects involve multiple cost categories (equipment, labor, materials, subcontractors) with target profit margins of 25-60%

This project addresses the gap between generic CRMs that lack industry-specific features and expensive enterprise solutions that are overkill for small-to-medium smart home integration businesses.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** Create the definitive CRM platform that empowers smart home integration companies to efficiently manage customer relationships, streamline project execution, and maximize profitability through intelligent automation and mobile-first design.

- **Primary Goals:**

  - Goal 4: Enable field technicians to complete status updates in under 2 minutes via mobile interface
  - Goal 5: Provide real-time project analytics and financial insights for business decision-making

- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - User adoption rate among field technicians (target: 90%+ daily active usage)
  - Average time to complete common tasks (project updates, customer data entry)

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

**Constraints:**
- **Budget:** Targeting small-to-medium businesses, cost-effective hosting required (projected 400-1,550 MB/year storage growth)
- **Performance:** Must handle 1-1000 customers efficiently, with scalability to enterprise levels
- **Mobile Requirements:** Primary interface for field technicians, must work with gloves and in various lighting conditions
- **Offline Capability:** Field work requires basic functionality without internet connection
- **Data Security:** Customer financial and personal information requires robust security measures

**Initial Architectural Preferences:**
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo approach currently implemented with Next.js frontend and Express backend
- **Database:** SQLite for development/small deployments, with clear migration path to PostgreSQL for scale
- **Service Architecture:** Monolithic approach suitable for MVP, designed with clear separation for future microservices migration
- **Technology Stack:** 
  - Frontend: Next.js 15+ with TypeScript, Material-UI, Emotion CSS-in-JS
  - Backend: Express.js with Prisma ORM for database management
  - Database: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production scale)
  - Authentication: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing
  - File Storage: Local file system with cloud migration path

**Risks:**
- **Technical Challenge:** Offline mobile functionality complexity
